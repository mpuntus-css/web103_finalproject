## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 your answer here]
Our collaboration went really well. As a group, we communicated clearly and consistently, which made it easy to divide tasks based on each person’s strengths and experience. This helped us stay organized and work efficiently throughout the project.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 your answer here]
One of the major challenges we faced involved debugging during the integration stage. Since we split the work between the front-end and back-end, connecting both sides introduced a lot of unexpected issues. It took time to trace the bugs and ensure everything worked smoothly together.

### 3. What were some of the highlights or achievements that you are most proud of in this project?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 your answer here]
One highlight I’m especially proud of is how our team pushed through the integration challenges and still delivered a functional final product. We stayed patient, communicated well, and problem-solved effectively as a group. I’m also proud of how much our final project showcased our growth in both technical skills and teamwork.

### 4. Reflecting on your web development journey so far, how have you grown since the beginning of the course?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 your answer here]
I'd say that we've definitely grown a lot since the beginning of the course. The labs, examples, and lectures were extremely helpful and gave me hands-on practice that strengthened our understanding of real web development workflows. Working on the final project especially helped us learn how to collaborate within a team, manage tasks, and apply concepts to build something meaningful from start to finish.

### 5. Looking ahead, what are your goals related to web development, and what steps do you plan to take to achieve them?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 your answer here]
Looking forward, our goal is to keep improving front-end and back-end skills so we can become more confident as a full-stack developer. To achieve this, we plan to continue building small personal projects, explore new frameworks and tools, and review areas where we feel less confident. We also want to keep practicing teamwork and collaboration, since real-world development relies heavily on effective communication and shared problem-solving.
