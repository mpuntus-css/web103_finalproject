## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

I really liked how my partner, Salah, and I collaborated through Slack. We communicated effectively, divided our tasks evenly, and worked together efficiently to accomplish milestone 1. I also appreciated how we stayed organized, productive, and proactive throughout the process, which helped us stay on track and meet our deadlines smoothly.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

One of the main challenges we faced was waiting for the Tech Fellows to assign groups and create Slack channels for team communication. Since we didn’t want to panic or fall behind, we decided to reach out to each other and create our own group instead. Another challenge was that we couldn’t find the third member of our team in Slack, which was a bit frustrating and caused some confusion early on.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

For now, everything is going well. The only support we might need is help finding our third partner for the project, although it’s perfectly fine if it remains just the two of us. As we move forward with development, we might need some technical guidance or troubleshooting help when building and refining our app, but we’ll see how it goes as we progress.
